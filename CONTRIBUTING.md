- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Repository changes (Through pull requests)

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your new branch from `main`.
3. Make your changes
4. Stage and commit your changes to your local branch
5. Push to your forked repo
6. Open a pull request to be merged into this repo's `main`

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/beyluta/tf2-server-launcher/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue. It's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a well-documented bug report. Use this as the base for your bug report if possible.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [This stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* can reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* well-documented bug reports.
