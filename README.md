### Start by installing the dependencies using npm

```
npm i
```

To work on the interface, use `ng serve` to start the development server. This will not enable the functionalities built with Electron.
```
ng serve
```

To start the project with Electron, use `npm run start`. This compiles the project and starts the Electron app.
```
npm run start
```
